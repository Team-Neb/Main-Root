Decription:
Our game called Nebulous, it is a 2D platformer game. Our game has 2 levels if you kill certain amount of monster
and pick up the key, you can go to another level. Monsters will go to player and if player don't attack, player will loss health. 
If player health = 0, the game will reset. You can pause, resume, or quit the game anytime you want.

How to play:
Use Left Arrow and Right Arrow to move left and right
Use "A" to attack
If monters drop items, go forward to the item to pick up
The game have 3 types of items drop.
- a Heart: return 1 health to player
- a Star: return full health to player 
- a Key: the key to the next level.
